#pragma omp parallel
Creates a parallel region where multiple threads execute concurrently. Everything within the region runs in parallel.
#pragma omp for
Used to parallelize loops, splitting the iterations among multiple threads.
#pragma omp critical
Defines a critical section, ensuring that only one thread at a time can execute the code within the section.
#pragma omp sections

Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort Overview: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Sequential Bubble Sort: In each iteration, the largest element "bubbles" to the end, reducing the unsorted range.
Parallel Bubble Sort:
Use OpenMP to parallelize the comparisons and swaps within a single pass of the array.
Ensure synchronization to avoid race conditions when multiple threads swap elements.
Effective parallelization depends on even work distribution and correct synchronization.

Merge Sort
Merge Sort Overview: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively splits an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them.
Sequential Merge Sort: The array is recursively divided until the base case is reached, then merging combines sorted halves into a single sorted array.
Parallel Merge Sort:
Use OpenMP to parallelize the recursive splitting and merging of arrays.
Each split can be assigned to a separate thread, allowing concurrent sorting of subarrays.
Merging step requires synchronization to ensure correct order of elements.
Effective parallelization requires balancing the load across threads.

Min, Max, Sum, and Average Operations
Min Operation: Finds the minimum value among a set of elements.
Parallel reduction identifies the smallest value by comparing elements in parallel.
Use #pragma omp parallel for reduction(min:variable) to determine the minimum value concurrently.
Max Operation: Finds the maximum value among a set of elements.
Parallel reduction identifies the largest value by comparing elements in parallel.
Use #pragma omp parallel for reduction(max:variable) for concurrent calculation.
Sum Operation: Calculates the total sum of a set of elements.
Parallel reduction computes the sum by adding elements concurrently.
Use #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:variable) to achieve this.
Average Operation: Computes the mean value from a set of elements.
Combine parallel reduction for the sum with the total count of elements to get the average.
Use #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:variable) to get the total sum, then divide by the total count.

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a class of neural networks with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers. Here's a summary of their key characteristics and applications in five points:
Multi-Layer Structure:
DNNs consist of multiple hidden layers, allowing them to learn complex hierarchical representations from raw input data. The depth (number of layers) distinguishes DNNs from simpler neural networks.
Activation Functions:
Activation functions introduce non-linearity, enabling DNNs to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Sigmoid, and Tanh.
Learning and Backpropagation:
DNNs are trained using backpropagation, where the network learns by adjusting weights through gradient descent. This process involves calculating gradients of a loss function to minimize prediction error.
Applications Across Domains:
DNNs are used in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, reinforcement learning, and more. Their versatility and capability to learn complex features make them suitable for a wide range of tasks.
Challenges and Solutions:
DNNs are prone to overfitting due to their complexity. Techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and regularization are used to improve generalization. Training DNNs also requires substantial computational resources, often addressed through parallel computing with GPUs or TPUs.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural network designed to process data with a grid-like topology, like images and videos. Here are five key points that capture the essence of CNNs:
Convolutional Layers:
CNNs use convolutional layers to apply filters or kernels to the input data, allowing the network to detect local patterns, like edges, textures, and shapes. These layers slide over the input, creating feature maps that capture the presence of specific features.
Pooling Layers:
Pooling layers, such as max pooling and average pooling, are used to reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps. This reduces computational complexity, controls overfitting, and focuses on the most significant features.
Hierarchical Feature Learning:
CNNs learn features in a hierarchical manner, with early layers capturing low-level features and deeper layers identifying more complex patterns. This hierarchy makes CNNs particularly effective for tasks like image classification, object detection, and facial recognition.
Fully Connected Layers:
After several convolutional and pooling layers, CNNs often use fully connected (dense) layers to combine the features and make predictions. These layers resemble traditional neural networks and are typically followed by activation functions like ReLU or Softmax.
Applications and Versatility:
CNNs are widely used in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. They also find applications in other domains, like audio analysis, medical imaging, and natural language processing, demonstrating their versatility.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network designed to process sequential data, with an emphasis on maintaining context or memory across time. Here are five key points that summarize RNNs:
Sequential Processing and Recurrence:
RNNs are designed to work with sequences, such as time series or text, by maintaining an internal state (or hidden state) that persists across time steps. This recurrence allows RNNs to consider the context of past data when making predictions.
RNN Architectures:
RNNs come in various architectures, with the most common being the standard RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). LSTM and GRU were developed to address the "vanishing gradient" problem that affects traditional RNNs, enabling better learning of long-range dependencies.
Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT):
RNNs are trained using a specialized form of backpropagation known as Backpropagation Through Time. This method considers the sequential nature of RNNs, calculating gradients over multiple time steps to update the network's weights.
Common Applications:
RNNs are well-suited for tasks involving sequential or time-based data. They are used in natural language processing (NLP) for tasks like language modeling, machine translation, and sentiment analysis, as well as in time series analysis, speech recognition, and more.
Challenges and Solutions:
RNNs can suffer from issues like vanishing gradients and exploding gradients. Solutions like LSTM and GRU mitigate these problems through gating mechanisms. Additionally, techniques such as gradient clipping and regularization can help manage these challenges and improve model stability.
